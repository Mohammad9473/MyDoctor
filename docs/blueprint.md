# **App Name**: MediScript Connect

## Core Features:

- User Authentication: Secure user authentication and authorization for patients and doctors with role-based access control.
- Prescription Request Workflow: Patients describe their symptoms/condition and submit a prescription request. Doctors receive requests based on their specialization.
- Prescription Management & Delivery: Doctors create prescriptions and securely send them to patients via email. Note: Implement email sending functionality with proper error handling (using environment variables for sensitive data).

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: White (#FFFFFF) for a clean, professional look.
- Secondary color: Light gray (#F5F5F5) for backgrounds and subtle contrasts.
- Accent: Teal (#008080) for buttons, links, and interactive elements.
- Clean and readable sans-serif fonts for body text and headings.
- Use a consistent set of medical-themed icons for navigation and information display.
- Responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- Subtle transitions and animations for a smooth user experience (e.g., loading indicators, button hover effects).
